            After two years of playing together during Michelâ€™s long stay in Iran, a new project was born. Badieh blew a
            new life into old pieces and dances from Iranian and Afghan Khorasan, a very important geographical area in
            the history of Persia and the Silk Road. The majority of the chosen pieces by Michel and Mohammad are over
            200 years old but, thanks to oral tradition, they are still alive in these borderlands.

            In this project, we can hear some of the most essential instruments of Persian Classical music, like the Tar
            and Setar along with the Arab Oud, the Afghan Rubab and Dutar accompanied by Tombak, Bendhir and Tabla. Some
            of these instruments are scarcely heard when traditional musicians play this repertory; so without losing
            authenticity, a different atmosphere is given to these pieces.

            We owe our name to one of the most important rivers in the Levant, beginning in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, crossing Syria and the ancient city of Antioch and ending in the Mediterranean Sea. Orontes is formed by musicians specialised in different musical
            traditions from the Middle East, Afghanistan, Spanish Flamenco and Jazz. Even though Middle Eastern Music is one of the main influences in Orontes, the band transports us with their powerful live show to many different atmospheres with a unique
            sound in Modal and Mediterranean Music scene. Adding some Jazz and African touch to their music without losing their Iberian character.

                Orontes was born in Madrid from Michel Gasco´s compositions, a project that was joined rapidly by his bandmates in other music projects, Alberto Centella Flute and Bansuri player, and Pancho Brañas as the Percussionist. They recorded the album between
                the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, and it was then when the violinist and producer, Vic Guadiana, joined the band along with the Double Bass player, Jose Conde. 4 October 2019, their first album “Dancing on the Heads of Snakes”
                was published by the Australian record label World Within Worlds, with great reviews in Australia’s Sydney Morning Herald and the Swedish World Music Magazine, Lira.

                The first single of the album, Dimashq Blues, is Michel Gasco´s tribute to the people and city of Damascus, city were he lived and started learning the Oud, before he moved to Aleppo, in the north of Syria. The videoclip of Dimashq Blues is mix between
                the videos taken while recording the piece in the studio, and videos recorded by Michel Gasco during the time he was living in Damascus, between 2008 and 2010

                The first shows of the band were a 5-concert tour in Japan in December 2018. Later, they presented their music for the first time in Spain’s capital in June in two festivals, first “Nights of Ramadan” and then in a festival to celebrate the 10th Anniversary
                of one of the most important intercultural institutions in Spain, “Casa Arabe”. It was in those shows where the great double bass player, Toño Miguel, joined the band.

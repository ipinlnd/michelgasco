            Michel Gasco and Worlds Within Worlds are proud to present Hanin: Field Recordings In Syria 2008/2009 - a
            snapshot of the diverse music and culture of pre-war Syria. All profits from this release will go directly
            to the musicians featured.
            <br />
            <br />
            in March, the conflict in Syria passed into its tragic tenth year. For many, the word Syria has become
            synonymous with conflict, with images of gunfire and shelling dominating news coverage. But what has been
            lost is the humanity of Syria’s many, diverse people, along with an understanding of their rich history and
            multitude of cultures - all of which endure in spite of the conflict.
            <br />
            <br />
            In response, Worlds Within Worlds has worked with film-maker and musician Michel Gasco to release Hanin:
            Field Recordings In Syria 2008/2009, a compilation which provides a snapshot of the diverse and vibrant
            music being created across the country. This collection features a range of classical, religious and folk
            musical performances and showcases some of the Levant’s most important instruments like the oud, the
            electric Buzuq), the qanun and the ney - as well as a range of vocal, solo and ensemble recordings.
            <br />
            <br />
            Opening with an improvisation from the acclaimed qanun maestro Ghassan Ammouri, the Ornina Ensemble then
            move to perform accompanied by the recitation of a poem from 14th century Yemeni Abdul Rahim Al Borai. As
            the album progresses, we hear a traditional piece from the Bedouin people of the Syrian desert, performances
            from acclaimed oud virtuosos, traditional ensembles and renown vocalists, and finally, a rare recording by
            followers of the Druze religion, who live in As-Suwayda province in Syria's south-west.
            <br />
            <br />
            These recordings were made in 2008 and 2009 by Spanish musician and film-maker Michel Gasco (Orontes,
            Badieh), under a grant from the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation and Development, with the intent
            of helping create a cultural dialogue between Syrian and Spanish musicians.
            <br />
            <br />
            “I ended up living in Syria for two years between 2008 and 2011”, Michel recalls. “It was an amazing feeling
            being there. I would wake up in the morning, take my oud and walk the streets of Aleppo or Damascus. I would
            have oud lessons with players like Mohammad Qadri Dalal or Hussein Sabsaby, or else spend hours at Ayman
            Jesry’s oud workshop in Aleppo. I will never forget the beautiful time I’ve spent with my dear friend,
            singer and oud player from Homs Issa Fayad, who very often would take me to his friends houses to have a
            night of live music.”
            <br />
            <br />
            Asked about the importance of this release, Michel explains, “Syria is one of the cradles of civilisation.
            Many empires have left their footprint here, and you can still find those footprints in their food, their
            architecture and the music. But importantly, Syria is not a stagnant place, or an open air museum for us to
            go and contemplate. On the contrary, its great artists are contributing to a vibrant and dynamic culture,
            creating new music and sounds while at the same time preserving their marvellous traditions and past.”
            <br />
            <br />
            “To me, music is an instrument of understanding - it doesn’t matter where you are from, if you understand
            the lyrics or not. Music can move you, touch you, and if you are curious enough you may end up reading and
            learning about the peoples and cultures where those songs that you like come from.”
            <br />
            <br />
            Sadly, after 10 years of conflict, half of the musicians featured in this collection have been forced to
            leave the country, and now live in countries like Lebanon, Turkey, Germany and Canada. Michel has maintained
            with all of them, and we are committed to ensuring that the profits from this release go back to the
            musicians who perform on this recording.
            <br />
            <br />
            We sincerely hope that this compilation will help open your heart and mind to the people of Syria.
